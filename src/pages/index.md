#  Digital photo management, unleashed.

The Adobe Lightroom software development kit (SDK) gives you a clean, fast, lightweight toolset for enhancing and extending the capabilities of the leading image management and sharing software. Plug-ins you build in Lua, the scripting language built into Lightroom, and the Lightroom SDK let you create effects, define image processing presets and brushes, add items to Lightroom menus and dialogs, manipulate metadata, and create new types of web galleries for your images. The guides, documentation, and sample code in the SDK shows you how to leverage Lua to access the Lightroom API, opening the power of the app to your control. Your plug-ins can be given away or sold in the [Adobe Exchange](https://exchange.adobe.com/addons) marketplace where users can browse and install extensions. Download the SDK today and discover the power to enhance and extend Lightroom as you see fit.

### Leverage the power of Lua

Write extensions built in C++ or JavaScript that use the API to add your own functionality to Dreamweaver. Scripts written in JavaScript can work with C++ extensions or stand on their own.

### Customize export and publish

Dreamweaver now supports CEP, which lets you build plug-ins and panels for Dreamweaver using HTML, CSS and JavaScript—no C++ required! Use CEP across Creative Cloud apps to integrate Dreamweaver into cross-app workflows.

### Work with metadata

The Dreamweaver API lets you access server-side data, load server-side scripts, and even support new web server models in your extensions.

### Enhance the Lightroom UI

Your extensions can modify the Dreamweaver UI in almost any way you want. Add new items to menus and toolbars or entirely new ones; create your own floating panels, reports, and property inspectors.
